                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Marvel Studios, LLC (originally known as Marvel Films from 1993 to 1996) is an American film and
                    television studio that is a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, a division of The Walt Disney
                    Company. Marvel Studios is known for the production of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, based on
                    characters that appear in Marvel Comics publications.</p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel Studios was also involved with the production
                    of other Marvel-character film franchises that have exceeded $1 billion in North American box office
                    revenue, including the X-Men and Spider-Man multi-film franchises.
                </p>

                    Marvel Studios is also producing television series airing on Disney+, and is overseeing production
                    for remaining Marvel Television series following its folding into Marvel Studios.
