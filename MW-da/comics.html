                    Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman under a number of corporations and imprints but now
                    known as Timely Comics,[3] and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel
                    era
                    began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles
                    created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been
                    used
                    over the years, was solidified as the company's primary brand.
